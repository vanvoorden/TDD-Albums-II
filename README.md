# TDD-Albums-II

Welcome! The TDD-Albums-II tutorial is a sequel to the original TDD-Albums library from 2015. The TDD-Albums library started as a hands-on tutorial for a few iPhone developers at eBay that were interested in learning Test-Driven Development. Our previous tutorial was written using Objective-C and UIKit. The TDD-Albums-II tutorial has been rewritten (from scratch) using the latest versions of Swift (5.5) and SwiftUI.

Like our previous tutorial, we will cover topics familiar to iOS engineers, like networking and concurrency, while working (almost) totally from TDD. Our tutorial also introduces topics familiar to TDD engineers, like dependency-injection and test-double types, while working from Swift, SwiftUI, and a little Objective-C.

TDD-Albums-II is appropriate for iOS engineers that have never attempted TDD (or never written a unit-test). Having said that, TDD-Albums-II is not intended as a tutorial to learn iOS engineering. It will be assumed that you have a strong competency in Swift and SwiftUI. You should also have a working knowledge of Objective-C.
